To use Cevoid plugin you need to have a cevoid.com account. This is because all handling of customer photos and user-generated content is managed in app.cevoid.com, not Wordpress.
The data that is sent to app.cevoid.com is product information so that we can keep track of products and tag them in photos from the user. We also need information about your store, such as URL to verify your store so that no other store can connect to your Cevoid account.
